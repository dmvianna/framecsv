# framecsv

95% shamelessly copied from a chat message by @idontgetoutmuch. This is just a simple example workflow from a CSV file to a PNG plot.

Building it will not create the plot. After building, one has to issue `$ stack exec -- framescv -o "out.png"` to get a file containing the plot.

Yes, I could have found a better CSV to plot with.
